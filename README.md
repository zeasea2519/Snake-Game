# Snake-Game
Snake game made using python and the pygame module. I used a tutorial for this then edited the code to make it work for my laptop.
I did this project over a weekend as I am trying to get back into coding after a break. 
While this code is not original and is largely based on a YouTube tutorial, I have changed things about the code such as the size of the window and the colour scheme to make it slightly more personalised.

Based on a YouTube tutorial by Clear Code.
